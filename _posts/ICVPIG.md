A few research papers I found interesting at the The Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing ( ICVGIP) 2018

In this blog, I highlight some of the research work that got my attention at ICVPIG 2018.


I recently had the pleasure of attending The Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing (ICVGIP) 2018 and I was taken away by the interesting and diverse problems and approaches people were working on. This was my first real conference visit and it showed me the desire and seriousness of the indian community to be part of global A.I research. Having previously being exposed to a limited amount of research and researchers, it set a standard for me personally and helped me to see my place in the larger scheme of things. I saw people dedicated and fascinated by new advances and willing to challenge themselves and take on hard problems. 

While I previously held up ‘A.I’ as this massive cloud that's going to change the world, at times it felt like I was in a 
microcosm, a microcosm of the computer vision community, and that there were probably a lot of other microcosms out there 
where people believed what they were working on would change the world. It made me feel extremely small at times and I 
realized its more important to work on something you love rather than something you think has a lot of opportunity. 
Since, then I’ve dug deeper to pinpoint the things that I, only I, enjoy about my work and build and a deeper appreciation 
of some of the important pieces of knowledge easily looked over.

I was surprised by how much I personally understood.  Going through the list of events prior to the conference I actually 
laughed out at the fact that none of it seemed remotely comprehensible to me. I wondered if I would even understand the 
objective of most papers, much less their content. But it turned out that most papers with daunting names were simple 
concepts with a few minor modifications and I was in much better shape than I expected. It reinforced to me the notion 
that spending time contemplating the basics or core elements will make understanding new things significantly easier.
