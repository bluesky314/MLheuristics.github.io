title: Guessing the Central Limit Theorem
---

An attempt to make properties of the Guassian Distribution intuitive

Perhaps the one topic in all statistics that is as prevalent as it is shrouded in mystery. Your professors and seniors failed to explain it and great textbooks introduce by pulling it 
out of a magic hat. 

Here we will take part in function finding. Narrowing down the possible functions via figuring out properties that our function must obey. Perhaps an easier way to know the prevelance of the Gaussian is to identify some key properties and once we see a situation where we must have those, we can guess its the Guassian.
I guarentee you after this( and some of your own thought) you will walk away finding the foundations of the Guassian more intuitive
